### **1\. Definition**:

Transaction propagation refers to the process by which a transaction is broadcast and disseminated across nodes in a blockchain network.

### **2\. Steps in Transaction Propagation**

**Step 1. Transaction Creation:**

A user initiates a transaction using their wallet software.

*The wallet:*

\- Creates a signed transaction using the user’s private key.

\- Verifies that the transaction meets basic rules (e.g., the sender has sufficient funds).

**Step 2. Broadcast to a Node:**

\- The signed transaction is sent to a nearby node (a computer participating in the blockchain network). -

This is usually the wallet’s connected node.

**Step 3. Validation by Receiving Node:**

The receiving node validates the transaction by:

\- Verifying the digital signature

\- Checking that the sender has enough balance.

\- Ensuring the transaction adheres to network rules (e.g., gas limits or fee requirements).

\- If valid, the transaction is added to the **mempool**.

**Step 4. Propagation to Peer Nodes:**

\- The node broadcasts the validated transaction to its peer nodes.

\- This process continues recursively, spreading the transaction across the network.

\- Propagation speed depends on: network latency and the number of connected peers.
