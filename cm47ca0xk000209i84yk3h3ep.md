## ETH Nodes vs ETH Clients

Ethereum nodes and clients are fundamental components of the Ethereum network. Nodes are the network participants that maintain and validate the blockchain, ensuring its integrity. Clients are the software applications that nodes use to interact with the network, handle transactions, and execute smart contracts. Together, they work to keep the Ethereum ecosystem operational, secure, and up-to-date. Understanding and managing both effectively is crucial for participating in and maintaining the Ethereum network.

| Aspects | Ethereum Node | Ethereum Client |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Definition | A computer participating in the Ethereum network maintains a copy of the blockchain. | A software application that implements the Ethereum protocol and allows nodes to interact with the network. |
| Function | Stores, processes, and verifies blockchain data; participates in the network’s operations. | Provides the interface and functionality for nodes to communicate with the Ethereum network, process transactions, and execute smart contracts. |
| Types | Full Node, Light Node, Archive Node. | Geth (Go-Ethereum), OpenEthereum, Besu, Nethermind. |
| Role in Network | Ensures blockchain integrity and consensus by validating transactions and blocks. | Implements protocol rules, facilitates node communication, and handles transaction creation and broadcasting. |
| Data Storage | Depends upon the node type. | Manages how data is processed and stored. |
| Network Interaction | Directly participates in the Ethereum network by connecting to other nodes and sharing data. | Interacts with the network on behalf of the node, handling tasks such as syncing with the blockchain and processing transactions. |
| Maintenance | Includes managing hardware resources, ensuring proper synchronization, and securing the node. | Involves updating the software, configuring network settings, and managing protocol changes. |

## What is a Node?

An Ethereum node is a computer that is running the software client. The [blockchain](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blockchain-technology-introduction/) network comprises nodes, which are the only methods to access it. Nodes communicate with one another to validate transactions and record data about the status of the blockchain. On the Ethereum network, these computers or servers are responsible for storing, validating, and trading data.

1. Each node keeps its copy of the blockchain and strives to verify that it matches the copies of all the other nodes.
    
2. Every node on the network must process any action that requires a new block to be added to the blockchain.
    
3. This network of continually communicating nodes allows us to avoid relying on a single source of truth and all of the challenges it entails.
    
4. A new block is added based on whether or not the majority of nodes accept it.
    

## Node Responsibilities and Functions

Here are some responsibilities and functions of nodes in [Ethereum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ethereum/):

1. **Maintains Blockchain Data:** An Ethereum node stores a copy of the entire blockchain or a subset of it. This data includes all transactions and smart contracts that have been processed by the network.
    
2. **Validates Transactions:** Nodes verify the validity of transactions and blocks by checking that they adhere to the rules of the Ethereum protocol. This process helps ensure that only legitimate transactions are added to the blockchain.
    
3. **Propagates Transactions:** Nodes help propagate transactions and blocks across the network, ensuring that all participants have up-to-date information.
    
4. **Supports Network Consensus:** By participating in the consensus mechanism (e.g., [Proof of Stake](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/proof-of-stake-pos-in-blockchain/) or [Proof of Work](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blockchain-proof-of-work-pow/)), nodes contribute to the process of agreeing on the state of the blockchain and adding new blocks.
    
5. **Interacts with Clients:** Nodes use Ethereum clients (software applications) to interact with the blockchain. Clients handle various network functions, such as executing smart contracts and querying blockchain data.
    

## Types of Ethererum Nodes

Ethereum Nodes are a system that operates in a Point to Point network model. There are 3 types of Nodes:

### 1\. Full Nodes

The responsibility of a full node is to verify and validate every transaction that takes place inside the network and maintain the state of the blockchain. When a smart contract transaction occurs, full nodes also execute all of the instructions in the smart contract. It determines whether or not the smart contract execution is producing the expected results. These nodes maintain a full copy of the blockchain data.

1. It keeps receiving copies of the entire blockchain including its transactions which are stored locally and keeps the latest state of transaction with itself.
    
2. When a smart contract transaction occurs, full nodes also execute all of the instructions in the smart contract.
    
3. It determines whether or not the smart contract execution is producing the expected results.
    
4. Consider an example where person A performs a transaction with person B, this transaction is added to the blockchain, and then the full nodes verify whether the transaction complies with all the Ethereum specifications, and maintain the latest state of the blockchain by storing or removing the specification if it does not comply.
    
5. An example of a discarded transaction is when a person transfers X ETH to another person but their account contains less ETH.
    

### 2\. Archive Nodes

Archive nodes are complete nodes that have the “archive mode” option enabled. While a Full Node only stores the latest state of the transaction, the Archive nodes hold all of the blockchain’s history data dating back to the Genesis block.

1. The Archive node is used when blocks before the latest 128 blocks are required.
    
2. For example, using functions like eth\_getBalance of a historic address would require an archive node, as well as interacting with smart contracts launched far earlier in the blockchain.
    
3. Because of its special feature, Archive Nodes require more than 6 Terabytes of space, contrary to Full Node which only requires a little over 500 Gigabytes of disk space.
    
4. So, it can be inferred, that archive nodes are not useful for average people, they are effective in the application of block exploring, wallet vending, and chain analytics.
    

### 3\. Light Nodes

A light node, unlike a full node, does not hold the complete current blockchain state and stores only the block header. It is suitable for low-memory and computational devices since maintaining a light node involves the least investment in hardware, running costs, and technical skills.

1. Light nodes rely on full nodes to function.
    
2. These nodes do not need to run continuously or read and publish a large amount of data on the blockchain.
    
3. It provides an easy way to create a wallet, especially for beginners.
    
4. For example, Solid-State Drives cannot afford to store the gigabytes of data that other nodes take.
    

But there are some limitations of light nodes which cannot be denied, there is no guarantee that the light wallet provider will be online when it is needed.

### 4\. Pruned Nodes

Pruned nodes are similar to full nodes but with a smaller data footprint. They store a complete copy of the blockchain but delete older state data that is no longer needed for current operations.

1. They maintain a full copy of blockchain transactions but with reduced storage requirements.
    
2. Pruned nodes provide most of the functionalities of a full node while conserving disk space.
    
3. They are suitable for users who want to run a full node with reduced storage requirements.
    

### 5\. Validator Nodes

Validator nodes participate in Ethereum’s Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where they propose and validate new blocks based on their stake in the network.

1. Validator nodes propose and validate new blocks.
    
2. Stake ETH as collateral to ensure honest behavior.
    
3. They participate in network consensus and earn rewards for validating blocks.
    
4. They are specific to Ethereum 2.0 and its PoS mechanism, used by those who want to earn rewards by securing the network.
