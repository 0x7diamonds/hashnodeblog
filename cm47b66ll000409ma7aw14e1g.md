The mempool (short for memory pool) is a temporary storage area in each node where unconfirmed transactions are kept before being included in a block.

## Role of mempool

### Transaction Staging Area

* When a tx is broadcast and validated, it enters the mempool.
    
* It stays there until a miner or validator includes it in a block.
    

### Transaction Prioritization

* Transactions are often sorted in the mempool based on:
    
    * Tx Fee: Higher fees are prioritized.
        
    * Tx Size: Smaller txs might be preferred due to size limits.
        
* Miners select txs from the mempool to maximize their rewards.
    

### Global View

* Each node maintains its own mempool, but they tend to converge as nodes propagate txs.
    
* However, the content of mempools may differ slightly due to network delays or policies
    

## How Txs Are Processed From The Mempool

### 1\. Miner Selection

* Miners or Validators select txs from the mempool.
    
* they prioritize txs to optimize their optimize their block rewards.
    

### 2\. Block Inclusion

* Selected txs are added to a block.
    
* Once a block is mined and propagated, its txs are removed from the mempool.
    

## Example Workflow: BTC Tx Propagation and Mempool

*Step 1:*

*User creates txs:* Alice sends 0.1 BTC to Bob using her wallet. Her wallet calculates the transaction fee and creates the transaction.

*Step 2:*

*Broadcast to Node:* Aliceâ€™s wallet sends the signed transaction to the closest Bitcoin node.

*Step 3:*

*Validation and Mempool Addition* The node verifies the transaction and adds it to its mempool.

*Step 4:*

*Propagation:* The node shared the tx with its peers, which validate and propagate it further.

*Step 5:*

*Mining:* A miner selects the tx from the mempool (usually prioritizing higher fee).

*Step 6:*

*Block Inclusion:* The miner includes the tx in a new block, mines it, and broadcasts the block to the network.

*Step 7:*

*Tx Removal:* Once the block is confirmed, all nodes remove the tx from their mempools.
